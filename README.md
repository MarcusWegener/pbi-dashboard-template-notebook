# Portable Power BI Dashboard Templates with Fabric Notebooks (PoC)

> **Goal**: Make Power BI dashboards **portable** by parameterizing field bindings so a template can be redeployed to a **different semantic model** with minimal manual work.

## Why this matters
Power BI report definitions often contain **hard-coded** bindings (tables, columns, measures). Reusing a great dashboard across workspaces or customers becomes manual and brittle.  
This Proof of Concept shows how a Fabric Notebook can **re-bind** those references programmatically using `semPy`, enabling a reusable **dashboard catalog** / **dashboard factory** pattern.

## What‚Äôs inside
- A Fabric Notebook that:
  - loads a reference **template** report,
  - applies **parameterized mappings** from placeholders ‚Üí target semantic model,
  - updates the report definition via `semPy`,
  - and lets you validate the result in seconds.
- Minimal demo configuration; **no sensitive data** required.

> This PoC builds on the public reference model and template in this repository.

## Quick Start (Fabric)
1. **Upload the notebook** to a **Fabric workspace** backed by Fabric capacity.  
2. In the notebook‚Äôs **configuration section**, set the following variables to match your **target semantic model**:
   - `workspace_id` ‚Äì GUID of the Fabric workspace containing the target model  
   - `dataset_id` ‚Äì GUID of the target **semantic model** (Power BI dataset)  
   - `act_measure` ‚Äì name of the **Actuals** measure to bind (e.g., `Sales Amount`)  
   - `bud_measure` ‚Äì name of the **Budget** measure to bind (e.g., `Budget Amount`)  
   - `dimension` ‚Äì dimension column used in visuals (e.g., `Customer.Name`)  
   - `report_name_override` ‚Äì optional new report name for the deployed copy  
3. **Run** the notebook.  
4. **Open the generated report** ‚Üí check the loaded **Monitoring Dashboard** and enjoy üòä

> Tip: Keep a small **mapping registry** (CSV/JSON) if you deploy the template to many models. It improves repeatability and reviewability.

## Prerequisites
- Fabric capacity (trial or paid) and a workspace in Fabric
- **Contributor** (or higher) on the workspace
- **Build permission** on the target semantic model
- Python in notebooks is **Preview**; PySpark is **GA**
- `semPy` enabled
- The semantic model name must **not** end with a space

---

## Design Notes & Caveats
- **Visual Calculations** can keep logic close to visuals, reducing coupling to the model and improving portability.
- **Report-specific measures** are possible. For parametrization, define a dedicated **home table** for report measures.
- The `visual.json` references a **home table** for measures; therefore, placeholders in the template must be **unique and consistent** to support multiple home tables.
- This is a **Proof of Concept**. Expect to extend the mapping logic for broader coverage (e.g., custom visuals with special bindings).
